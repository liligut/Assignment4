      <h2>Definition of Function</h2>
      <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need for writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes.</p>

      <h2>Definition of Method</h2>
      <p>A method in object-oriented programming is a procedure associated with a class. A method defines the behavior of the objects that are created from the class. Another way to say this is that a method is an action that an object is able to perform. The association between method and class is called binding. A method is a function but it is associated with a class.</p>

      <h2>What does it mean to invoke a function?</h2>
      <p>A function call is the act of using a function by referring to its name,followed by parentheses. A synonymous term is function invocation, and we will sometimes say that we are "invoking a function."

      <h2>What is an argument?</h2>
      <p>Within parentheses, a comma-separated list of arguments may be provided when calling a function. These are sometimes called inputs, and we say that the inputs are "passed to" the function.</p>

      <h2>What is a common way to say you are providing inputs to a function?</h2>
      <p>You are "passing arguments to the function".</p>
