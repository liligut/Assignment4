        <p>I obtained a bachelor's degree at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_%22Marta_Abreu%22_of_Las_Villas" target="_blank">Central University of Las Villas, Cuba.</a> I studied at the university between 1998 and 2003. In these five years I studied many subjects related to mathematics and computing. Some of these subjects were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Algebra</li>
            <li>Logic</li>
            <li>Mathematical analysis</li>
            <li>Statistics and Probabilities</li>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In my career I learned the Delphi programming language. It is practically obsolete but has a lot in common with C-sharp and C ++. I also studied an introduction to Java and web programming with html and asp.</p>

        <h1>LaunchCode LC101 Tampa Bay March 2020 course.</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Launch code is a great opportunity that I plan to take advantage of as much as I can. This curse      has put me on the path of the programming again and it has made me realize programming is what I      most like to do.
