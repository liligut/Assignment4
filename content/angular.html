      <p>
          AngularJS is an app-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.
      </p>
      <p>
          The framework, written in pure JavaScript, was intended to decouple an application’s logic from DOM manipulation, and aimed at dynamic page updates. Still, it wasn’t very intrusive: you could have only a part of the page controlled by AngularJS. This framework introduced many powerful features allowing the developer to create rich, single-page applications quite easily.
      </p>
      <p>
         Specifically, an interesting concept of data binding was introduced that meant automatic updates of the view whenever the model (data) changed, and vice versa. On top of that, the idea of directives was presented, which allowed inventing your own HTML tags, brought to life by JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
          Another quite important thing was Dependency Injection, which allowed application components to be wired together in a way that facilitated reusable and testable code. Of course, there’s much more to AngularJS, but we’re not going to discuss it thoroughly in this article.
