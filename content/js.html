        <h1>JavaScript</h1>

        <p>
            JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.

        <h1>What can in-browser JavaScript do?</h1>
      </header>
        <p>
            Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.</li>
            <li>React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.</li>
            <li>Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).</li>
            <li>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.</li>
            <li>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</li>
        </ul>
